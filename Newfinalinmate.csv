Meanwhile, Cotton saw the Assistant  District Attorney outside the center and demanded money from him after pulling  a 380 semi-automatic pistol. The victim told Cotton he had no money but that he  had valuables in his car.

Cotton reportedly ordered Watson to shoot the man in the car blowing  his horn and then fired two shots into the Assistant District Attorney's head.  As the robbers attempted to flee on their bicycles, the man in the other  vehicle gave chase in his car and struck Cotton, who with Watson managed to  escape on foot by jumping a fence.
