Project as part of a Data warehousing & data mining module.
We are aiming to predict the sentiment of the final statement of an inmate on deathrow, e.g. whether or not they show remorse, are they postive, negative, religious or in denial - based on attributes such as their age at the time of the crime, prior convictions, type of crime committed, etc.
