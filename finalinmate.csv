Cotton and  accomplice Lawrence Watson, both armed with pistols, were riding bicycles  through the community center parking lot when Watson spotted another male  exiting his vehicle. Watson approached this male, put a .38-caliber pistol to  his head, and robbed him of his cash. Meanwhile, Cotton saw the Assistant  District Attorney outside the center and demanded money from him after pulling  a 380 semi-automatic pistol. The victim told Cotton he had no money but that he  had valuables in his car. As Cotton put him in the back seat of his Mustang,  the other robbery victim, who had gone driving around to the front of the  community center to call police, again drove into the parking lot and began  blowing his car horn and blinking his lights in an effort to ward off the  robbers. Cotton reportedly ordered Watson to shoot the man in the car blowing  his horn and then fired two shots into the Assistant District Attorney's head.  As the robbers attempted to flee on their bicycles, the man in the other  vehicle gave chase in his car and struck Cotton, who with Watson managed to  escape on foot by jumping a fence. Following his arrest, Watson implicated  Cotton, telling police that Cotton killed the Assistant District Attorney  because he had seen the gold badge the victim carried with him as a member of  the district attorney��_��__��_��_s office.
